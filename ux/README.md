UX improvements for the Binance skill — shared/ux

This folder contains a small prototype and UX-focused utilities to improve natural-language trading, dialog-based interaction, Telegram inline-button confirmations and symbol autocompletion.

Structure
- parser.py — Natural-language command parser (Russian + English). Parses orders like "купи 0.1 BTC по рынку", "Sell 2 ETH at 1800 limit".
- interactive.py — Dialog manager that guides the user, validates parsed commands and builds friendly confirmations.
- telegram_bot_prototype.py — Minimal Telegram bot prototype showing how to integrate parser + dialog with inline buttons (Confirm / Edit / Cancel). Uses python-telegram-bot style; meant as a template, not a running service in this repo.
- autocomplete.py — Symbol autocompletion helper, provides fast suggestions for pair symbols and base assets.
- templates.py — User-friendly message templates and confirmation layout examples.
- examples.md — Quick usage examples and sample commands.

How to use
1. Parse a natural-language command:
    python3 parser.py "купи 0.1 BTC по рынку"

2. Use DialogManager (interactive.py) to walk through missing fields and produce a confirmation message.

3. Use telegram_bot_prototype.py as a starting point to wire up a Telegram bot. The prototype uses InlineKeyboardButtons: Confirm / Edit / Cancel. It demonstrates safety rules (always show details before execution).

Design notes
- Conservative safety: parser returns a structured object but does NOT execute any trade. The dialog manager explicitly requires confirmation.
- Autocomplete uses a small curated list of popular symbols from SKILL.md and can be extended by fetching exchange metadata.
- Messages are designed to be short, clear and show all important details (pair, side, quantity, order type, price when relevant).
