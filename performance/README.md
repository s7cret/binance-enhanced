Performance helpers for Binance skill

This directory contains utilities that improve performance of Binance-related operations:

Files:
- cache.py — in-memory cache implementations (price TTL cache, balances cache, invalidation helpers)
- async_api.py — asynchronous API client with parallel requests, queueing/rate-limiting and retry logic
- jq_cache.py — small helper to cache jq filter files to speed up repeated jq usage
- benchmark.py — simple benchmark and metrics collector for measuring throughput and latency
- metrics.json — (generated by benchmarks) stores measured metrics

Usage examples are included in each file's __main__ section. Place these files into your deployment and import the classes or run the benchmark to verify improvements.

Notes:
- The code uses orjson when available for faster JSON parsing. If orjson is not installed it falls back to stdlib json.
- The async client uses aiohttp. If your environment lacks it, install via: pip install aiohttp
- The rate limiter is a simple token-bucket implementation which is good for typical Binance rate-limits — adjust parameters for your needs.

All files should be saved under shared/performance/
